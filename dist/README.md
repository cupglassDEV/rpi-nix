# Rpi-nix Distribution
All of this is the distributable version, the format would be like this
```
{version}/{iso here, can be anything}
```
(i intentionally added the space between the dates just so it dosent make any confusion between the other version and the release date)

## NOTE
This package is builded by Github Action, you can see the commit history if you want to
