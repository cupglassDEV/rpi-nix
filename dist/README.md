## Rpi-nix Distribution
All of this is the distributable version, the format would be like this
```
cgdnix-{rpi version}-{nix version}-{commit version}-{release day} {release month} {release year}.iso.zstd
```
(i intentionally added the space between the dates just so it dosent make any confusion between the other version and the release date)
