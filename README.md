# Rpi-nix
This is my Nixos build for my raspberry pi 4.

Bcs im new to nix, credit to this youtube video for guiding me to this thing

## NOTE 
As always, no UBOOT. It will be buggy SO MUCH on the Raspberry pi itself

For the upcoming updates, this package is using BOTH of the Nixos' linux and Raspberry pi's linux fork. So it will be lag so much on build

But for normal experience with my pi, its fine tbh
